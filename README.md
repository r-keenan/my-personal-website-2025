# Welcome to my website makeover!

This is my portfolio and blog that I am currently working on. The backend is currently SvelteKit hosted on Vercel. The URL to see this code live is https://rosskeenan.com.

This repo replaces the website that I built in late 2021 that was created with Next.js (React) instead of SvelteKit. You can find that repo here: [GitHub Repo for 2021 Website](https://github.com/r-keenan/my-personal-website)

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:
